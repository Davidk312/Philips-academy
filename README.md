This project uses a development container running in Ubuntu WSL2 on Windows, providing a consistent development environment for all developers. It includes automatic OpenOCD setup for debugging, where the GDB server runs on Windows while debugging occurs within the container.

## Prerequisites

1. **Windows with WSL2 and Ubuntu**: Ensure you have Windows with WSL2 and Ubuntu installed
2. **Visual Studio Code**: Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the "Dev Containers" extension
3. **ST-Link**: Have an ST-Link debugger connected to your system

## Project Setup

1. **Initialize Submodules**:
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

2. **Open in VS Code**:
```bash
code .
```

3. When prompted, click "Reopen in Container" to start the development container

## Development Environment

The project uses a development container that provides:
- All necessary build tools and dependencies
- Automatic OpenOCD installation and configuration
- Integrated debugging support

### Automatic OpenOCD Setup

The container automatically:
1. Installs OpenOCD on your Windows system if not present
2. Sets up monitoring services for debugging communication
3. Manages the connection between the container and Windows-based GDB server

## Building and Debugging

### Building the Project

1. Select the `stm32f429zi` configuration in VS Code
2. Build using either:
   - VS Code's build command (Ctrl+Shift+B)
   - CMake commands in the terminal

### Debugging

1. Connect your ST-Link debugger
2. Press F5 to start debugging
   - The system will automatically:
     - Update the WSL IP address
     - Start OpenOCD if not running
     - Connect the debugger

## Testing

1. Select "Configuration for Host Tooling and Tests" in VS Code
2. Run tests using the "CMake: Run CTest" command

```

## Technical Details

- **Development Container**: Runs Ubuntu in WSL2
- **Debug Setup**: 
  - GDB Server: Runs on Windows via OpenOCD
  - Debug Client: Runs in container
  - Communication: Automated via monitoring services
- **Build System**: CMake with presets for different targets
- **Testing Framework**: Google Test

## Troubleshooting

If debugging doesn't start:
1. Check if OpenOCD is running (will be started automatically if needed)
2. Verify ST-Link connection
3. Ensure the WSL IP address is correctly updated

For other issues, check the VS Code output and debug console for detailed information.
